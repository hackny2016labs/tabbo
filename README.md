Chrome Tab Management Hotkeys!

## What is this??
Tabbo is a hotkeys management tool built specially for Google Chrome. It is built with the intention to be combined with other window management softwares to maximize productivity, and minimize the annoying mouse draggy, sometimes accidentally pop-offing, vanilla chrome UI/UX.

You can modify the hotkeys by navigating to chrome://settings/extensions/configureCommands in your chrome window.

The app features hotkeys for:
- moving tabs left and right
- popping tabs off of the current window
- sending tabs between windows (with custom UI)

We hope you all enjoy,

\- Tabbo team

Disclaimer!! â€“ Tabbo has access to the "<all_urls>" permission which gives it access to "All of your data". This allows the extension to take advantage of `captureVisibleTab` which allows you to see screenshots of your open windows (reference - https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tabs). No data is being had.
